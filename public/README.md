- Place your resume PDF here as `resume.pdf` to be served at `/resume.pdf`.
- Alternatively, set `VITE_RESUME_URL` in the project `.env` to an external URL (e.g., a direct PDF link) if you prefer hosting it elsewhere.

Examples:
- Local: `VITE_RESUME_URL=/resume.pdf`
- External: `VITE_RESUME_URL=https://example.com/your-resume.pdf`
